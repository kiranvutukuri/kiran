i wanna use this account for my project work
this website focuses on three major fields
1.informaton
2.selling products 
3.customer services

now i can explain each field

1.information
  this is a platform to know total information about  any city in our country.
a person want to buy a new product in the market,he/she will buy either online market or city-market.he does these things
first he gather few information about desired product from his friends then he choose better shop in the market.he went to shop then he chooses better one in 
the shop(for his convenient).if he does n't like it he will go to another shop,finally he buys.It is quit difficult to go each and every shop this is one problem.
second one is he ordered in online it is better way to buy a product in oline.when compare to online and city markets few items are cheap in online market,few
items are cheap in city market.you have a doubt, how can i tell city market is cheap ? i have an experience with online products,few months ago i had ordered 
a laptop bag i payed 700Rsfor bag+50rs for transport charges totally i payed 750rs.After i purchased bag i knew one thing actual cost of a bag in the city  
market is 580Rs.I realised when i buy a new product i cheked the cost of product in city market and online market. here we have a chance to buying products.
So we have to prefer both markets for buying new products.I already mentioned it is quit difficult to enquiring for a product or thing each and every shop.

            we are reading news papers,magazines sometimes we saw new items on news papers,and we liked it.we have a interest to buy that particular item but item
 is not available at that time.And we don't know how to buy it. if item will come city-market we dont know our desired item available in city market.Here you can 
check availablor not for desired item.
 So i wanted to develop these field . Here you can get these kind of information.you can see all products in your city or town, cost of the product,and also know 
that your product available at which shop.
              I want to tell an example for these field.Suppose i want to buy a T-shirt from our city. simply i search t-shirts in this site i will select for my
convenient .Here i know T- shirt available at which shop .I went to shop then buy  T-shirt.

    if you are uploaded data here that data can see whole people in the city,if they liked  you got an order from those who are liked your products.
 In this information field i included these shops(here you can see image of buying product ,cost of the product,cost of the product).
1. textile(cloths)
2.jewellery
3.food items
4.travelling
5.decoarating items
 and also know  information about  theatres, mechanic shops,vegtable shops(you can know daily market values in your city),kitchenware items ,electronics,book-shops,
hotels,tuition centers etc.

selling products

this is a platform to selling your products(cloths,slippers,food items etc).
here you can upload your product pictures and fix your prize in your city blog.
if new product available in your shop you can upload this site and sell it.this is like an advertising site.
my grandfather  is a saree designer(weaver).If he designed 10 sarees then sell it for lowcost.
he don't have a rite to fix his saree price.he dont have  money to start his own shop.so he sell it  with lowcost.
so i can say that this is a platform for new sellers.

customer -services
Here anyone can access this site
Here you can search what you want to buy? then know total description of your item ,and you know which shop gives better offers.
here i want to provide cash on delivery and also online paying .
